# Llama 3.2 explains implementing RAG in a local environment

**Please note that text below is entirely generated by Llama 3.2, using the prompt _"How can I import documents into my local ollama model to enable Retrieval-augmented Generation?"_**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models like OLLA with generation capabilities. To enable RAG, you'll need to modify your existing OLLA model to incorporate document embeddings and retrieval mechanisms.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps to import documents into your local OLLA model:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess your documents (e.g., text files, PDFs, etc.) to create a dataset for training and testing.
1. **Document Embeddings**: Use a technique like BERT-based document embeddings or Word2Vec to generate dense vector representations of each document. This will allow you to represent your documents in a high-dimensional space.
1. **Embedding Generation**: Modify your OLLA model to generate these document embeddings during inference, rather than relying on pre-trained weights.

## Here's a step-by-step guide:

### **Step 1: Prepare your data**

* Collect and preprocess your documents (e.g., tokenize, remove special characters, etc.)
* Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets

### **Step 2: Create document embeddings**

* Choose an embedding technique (e.g., BERT-based, Word2Vec)
* Train or fine-tune the model on your dataset to generate document embeddings
* Store the generated embeddings in a file or database for later use

### **Step 3: Modify your OLLA model**

* Update your OLLA model to include a retrieval mechanism (e.g., a simple cosine similarity function between the input prompt and document embeddings)
* Add code to generate document embeddings during inference, using the trained embeddings from Step 2
* Modify your model's architecture to accommodate the new embedding generation process

### **Step 4: Integrate with your RAG pipeline**

* Create a new interface or API that accepts user prompts and returns generated text based on the retrieved top documents
* Use your modified OLLA model to generate document embeddings for each input prompt
* Use these embeddings to retrieve relevant documents from a database or storage system
* Select the most relevant document(s) and use them as inputs for generation

Here's some sample Python code using the Hugging Face Transformers library to demonstrate how you might modify your OLLA model:
```
python
import pandas as pd
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from scipy import spatial

# Load pre-trained OLLA model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('ollamodel', num_labels=1024)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('ollamodel')

def generate_text(prompt):
    # Generate document embeddings for the input prompt
    inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(
        prompt,
        max_length=512,
        return_tensors='pt',
        padding='max_length'
    )
    
    # Retrieve top documents based on cosine similarity with the input embeddings
    top_docs = []
    for doc_id, doc_embedding in get_document_embeddings():
        sim = 1 - spatial.distance.cosine(inputs['input_ids'], doc_embedding)
        if sim > threshold:
            top_docs.append(doc_id)
    
    # Select top documents and use them as inputs for generation
    selected_docs = select_top_documents(top_docs)
    generated_text = model.generate(selected_docs, max_length=512)
    
    return generated_text

def get_document_embeddings():
    # Load document embeddings from database or storage system
    doc_embeddings = pd.read_csv('document_embeddings.csv')
    return list(doc_embeddings['doc_embedding'])

def select_top_documents(top_docs):
    # Select top documents based on some criterion (e.g., relevance score)
    # For this example, we'll just use the first top document
    selected_doc_id = top_docs[0]
    return [selected_doc_id]

# Test the modified model
prompt = "Write a story about a character who..."
generated_text = generate_text(prompt)
print(generated_text)
```

Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you'll need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, this example assumes a simplified retrieval mechanism; in practice, you may want to consider more advanced techniques like weighted cosine similarity or more sophisticated ranking algorithms.
